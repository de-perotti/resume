# 🔧 Quick Build Fix for the Epic Resume

## The Issue
The project fails to build due to `node-sass` requiring Python `distutils` which is not available in newer Python versions.

## ✅ Quick Fix (Recommended)

Replace `node-sass` with the modern `sass` package:

```bash
# Remove the problematic node-sass
npm uninstall node-sass

# Install the modern sass package
npm install sass

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## 🎯 Why This Works
- `sass` is the modern replacement for `node-sass`
- It doesn't require Python compilation
- Fully compatible with existing SCSS files
- Better performance and maintenance

## 🚀 Alternative Solutions

### Option 2: Use Node.js 16
```bash
# Install Node Version Manager (if not installed)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Install and use Node.js 16
nvm install 16
nvm use 16

# Try installing dependencies again
npm install
npm start
```

### Option 3: Use Yarn
```bash
# Install Yarn if not available
npm install -g yarn

# Install dependencies with Yarn
yarn install

# Start with Yarn
yarn start
```
